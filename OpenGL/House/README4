Project #: 4

Brief Description of Project: Apply what we learned in and outside of class about openGL and graphics using c coding, the coordinate system, color coding, and other variables. 

Additional contributions: Dr.Malloy, notes, internet

Difficulties: My only difficulties were debugging my program to get it to work and figuring out how the coordinate system worked.

Improvement Beyond Specs: I tried to go beyond just making a plain triangle on top of a square for the house by adding windows, a door, and grass.

Bugs: None that I know of

Drawbacks: (what I didn't do)
I didn't make the house as beautiful as I would have wanted it to be. I also did not put a variable key for switching colors as it did not look pleasing to me.
